Welcome my web adaptation of the classic code-breaking board game **[Mastermind](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)>)**, made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript!

This was made as my 3rd project for the Geekshub Academy Full Stack Delevoper Bootcamp.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Initial Screen**: You should choose a player name, difficulty, change the default colors if you will, and then press "Start".
2. **Initialization**: At the outset, the computer decides on a secret color code.
3. **Guesswork**: Now you should make your best guess by choosing a sequence of colors.
4. **Feedback**: After every guess, feedback is provided through pegs:
   - **White Peg**: Correct color but wrong position.
   - **Dark Peg**: Correct color but wrong position.
   - **Blue Peg**: Correct color and correct position.
5. **Victory**: The game concludes once the player successfully deduces the secret code.
