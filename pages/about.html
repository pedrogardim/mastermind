            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                This is a digital version of the classic code-breaking game. Players are tasked with deducing a hidden
                sequence of colors in as few guesses as possible.
                <br>
                With three levels of difficulty to choose from, the game
                caters to both beginners and experienced players.
                <br>
                A minimalist interface ensures distraction-free
                gameplay,
                while the local leaderboard feature allows for tracking of top scores. Challenge your logical and
                deductive
                skills with each round and aim for a spot on the leaderboard.

            <h3>How to play</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><u>Initial Screen:</u> You should choose a player name, difficulty, change the default colors if you
                    will, and then press "Start".</li>
                <li><u>Initialization:</u> At the outset, the computer decides on a secret color code.</li>
                <li><u>Guesswork:</u> Now you should make your best guess by choosing a sequence of colors.</li>
                <li><u>Feedback:</u> After every guess, feedback is provided through pegs:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>White Peg: Correct color but wrong position.</li>
                    <li>Dark Peg: Correct color but wrong position.</li>
                    <li>Blue Peg: Correct color and correct position.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><u>Victory:</u> The game concludes once the player successfully deduces the secret code.</li>
